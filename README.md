# RimWorld Add X Colonists Mod

Start a new game and at the world screen (where you pick your starting location) click the "Add X Colonists" button at bottom right.

**You must click this button for the mod to do anything.**

Tested with 200 pawns. Laggy but playable.

Tested with 500 pawns and the game's UI starts to disappear...

## Recommended Strategy

- assign more cooks
- set firefighting, patient, bed rest, basic to priority 1 (shift+click column header)
- plant rice ASAP
- build medical sleeping spots ASAP for somewhere to rescue/crawl to

## Recommended Mods

- automatically equip weapons: [FindAGunDamnIt!](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2089553836&searchtext=FindAGunDamnIt)
- set default outfits etc. for pawns: [Better Pawn Control](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1541460369)
- [Growing Zone Priorities](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2026571920)
- skip manually rescuing people: [Rescuing Job](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2222095509&searchtext=Rescuing+Job) (for 1.3 but still works)

## Ideas

- automatically assign random pawns cleaning and hauling priority 1 (can shift click and drag to do this manually)
  - maybe "less important" roles like artsy folk
  - assign all doctors priority 1 so they heal instead of fight fires
